# V0 Architecture

In v0 implementation, we focus on the very essential set of agents.

- The tweets will be manually generated to facilitate tests.
- Only text-formatted context will be included
- The translated texts will be directly feed to the user without evaluation and feedback.
- Only the text will be translated, other attributes won't be translated.
- Assume only handling 1 tweet at a time
- Only supports English and Chinese

# Flow Design

Due to the design/limitation of crewai Crew and Flow, I decided to separate the whole workflow (TranslationFlow) into 2 parts: Preparation and Translation, each is handled by a crew: PreparationCrew, TranslationCrew.

In v0, I will implement the 2 crews:
PreparationCrew contains TranslationPreparationAgent
TranslationCrew contains TranslationAgent

# Agent Design

## TranslationPreparationAgent

TranslationPreparationAgent passes text and context to translation agent

## TranslationAgent

TranslationAgent uses OpenAI language model to translate the text given the context

# Note

It is sufficient to use Sequential process to accomplish the requirement despite we already created the management agent

## Tweet structure
