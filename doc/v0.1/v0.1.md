# V0.1 Architecture #

In v0.1 implementation, in addition to the v0 requirements
- The tweets will be manually generated to facilitate tests. 
- Only text-formatted context will be included
- The translated texts will be directly feed to the user without evaluation and feedback. 
- Only the text will be translated, other attributes won't be translated. 
- Assume only handling 1 tweet at a time
- Only supports English and Chinese

we add 1 more requirement:
- Only provide context for the links appear in the text. 


# Agent Design #

## Context agent ##
The Context agent gets the extract links in the text from Translation Management agent, then uses selenium_scraping_tool to provide context, then pass the context back to the Translation Management agent.

# Note #
In v0.1 design, we will leverage Hierarchical process to ensure the translation starts after the context fetch completes
