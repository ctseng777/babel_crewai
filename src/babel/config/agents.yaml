    Tweet text and context recomposer
  goal: >
    Extract the text and context from a tweet and recompose it in an LLM friendly format.
    The output should contains the fields:
    - text: the text of the tweet, i.e. tweet["data"]["text"]
    - context: the context of the tweet, this can contain any fields other than text which are beneficial for translation work
    - language: the language of the tweet
    Note: some fields may not be present in the tweet and may not follow particular programming language's syntax, you should handle this gracefully
